## 21.Try **Transitions** instead of showing changes instantly.
Interface elements often appear, hide, move, shift, and resize as users do their thing. As elements respond to our interactions, it sometimes is a little easier to comprehend what just happened when we sprinkle in the element of time. A built in intentional delay in the form of an animation or transition, respects cognition and gives people the required time to understand a change in size or position. Keep in mind of course that as we start increasing the duration of such transitions beyond 0.5 seconds, there will be situations where people might start feeling the pain. For those who just wish to get things done quickly, too long of a delay of course can be a burden.

> ### 21.用一些动效过度而不用立即显示变化  
> 用户进行操作过程中，界面上的元素会经常出现，隐藏，打开，关闭，放大缩小移位等。给这些元素增加些自然的动画，淡入淡出效果不但美观，也更符合实际，本来元素尺寸位置的变化就是一个需要时间的动画过程。但要注意动画时间不要设置过长，那样会让想尽快完成操作的用户不耐烦。

## 22.Try **Gradual Engagement** instead of a hasty sign up.
Instead of asking visitors to sign up immediately, why not ask them to first perform a task through which something of value is demonstrated. During such initial interactions the product can both show off its benefits, as well as can lend itself to personalization. Once users begin to see your product’s value and see how they can make it their own, they will then be more open to sharing with you additional information. Gradual engagement is really a way to postpone the sign up process as much as possible and still allow users to use and customize your application or product.

> ### 22.循序渐进的引导用户而非生硬的要求用户注册  
> 与其让用户马上注册，何不让用户先进行一些体验式的操作呢。这个体验过程可以展示程序的功能，特性等。一旦用户通过简单几步的操作了解了程序的价值所在，那么它会更愿意填写注册表单的。这种循序渐进的引导可以尽量推迟用户注册的时间但又可以让用户在没注册的情况下进行个性化设置等简单操作。

## 23.Try **Fewer Borders** instead of wasting attention.
Borders compete for attention with real content. Attention of course is a precious resource since we can only grasp so much at any given time. Surely borders can be used to define a space very clearly and precisely, but they also do cost us cognitive energy as they are perceived as explicit lines. In order to define relationships between screen elements which use less attention, elements can also be just grouped together through proximity, be aligned, have distinct backgrounds, or even just share a similar typographic style. When working in abstract UI tools, it’s easy to drop a bunch of boxes everywhere. Boxes however come with a false sense of being immune from the order and unity which governs the rest of the screen. Hence pages with lots of boxes sometimes may tend to look noisy or misaligned. Sometimes it is helpful to throw in a line here and there, but do consider alternative ways of defining visual relationships that are less taxing to attention and your content will come through.

> ### 23.试着减少线框，减少不必要的注意  
> 过多边框会喧宾夺主。不用说，边框确实在划分区域进行版块设置时有很大的作用，但同时其明显的线条也会吸引走用户的注意力。为了达到划分版块又不转移用户注意力的目的，在排版时可以将界面上不同区域的元素通过空白进行分组，用上不同的背景色，将文字对齐方式进行统一，还有就是为不同区域设置不同的样式。当使用所见即所得的界面设计工具时，我们经常在界面上方便地拖出很多区块来，这些区块多了就会显得杂乱无章。所以我们又会到处放些横线来分界。一个更好的做法是将区块垂直对齐，这样做不会让那些多余的线条来扰乱视觉。

## 24.Try **Selling Benefits** instead of features.
I think this is Marketing 101. People tend to care less about features than they do about benefits. Benefits carry with them more clearly defined value. Chris Guillebeau in "The $100 Startup" writes that people really care about having more of: Love, Money, Acceptance and Free Time, while at the same time wishing for less Stress, Conflict, Hassle and Uncertainty. When showing features, and I do believe that there is still room for them occasionally, be sure to tie them back to benefits where possible.

> ### 24.向用户展示功能上的便捷之处而不是泛泛的展示特性  
> 市场就是这样的，用户永远只关心自身利益而产品特性对他们来说倒不是那么重要。只有利益才更直观地体现出使用产品所带来的价值。Chris Guillebeau在他的著作《100美元起家》中指出，相比压力，冲突，烦心事和未知的未来，人们在乎得更多的是爱，金钱，认同感和自由支配的空闲时间。所以我相信在展示产品特性时回归到利益上是必要的。

## 25.Try **Designing For Zero Data** instead of just data heavy cases.
There are cases when you will have 0, 1, 10, 100, or 10,000+ data results which might need to be displayed somehow in various ways. The most common of these scenarios is probably the transition from first time use with zero data towards future use with a lot more data. We often forget to design for this initial case when there is still nothing to display whatsoever, and by doing so we run the risk of neglecting users. A zero data world is a cold place. When first time users look at your app and all it does is show a blank slate without any guidance then you’re probably missing out on an opportunity. Zero data states are perfect candidates for getting users across the initial hurdle of learning by showing them what to do next. Good things scale and user interfaces are no exception.

> ### 25.用户没有使用记录的时候要善于引导  
> 界面上经常需要呈现不同数量的数据，从0，1，10，100到10000+等。这里存在个普遍的问题就是：在程序最开始使用的0条数据到过度到有数据之前，该如何进行显示界面。这也是我们经常忽视了的地方。当程序初始没有数据时，用户看到的就是一片空白，此时用户可能不知道该进行哪些操作。利用好没有数据的初始界面可以让用户学习和熟悉如何使用程序，在程序中创建数据。力臻完美永远是我们追求的目标，界面设计也不例外。

## 26.Try **Opt-Out** instead of opt-in. 
An opt-out strategy implies that users or customers are defaulted to take part in something without having to take any action. Alternatively, there is also the more traditional opt-in strategy that requires people to first take an action in order to take part in or receive something. There are two good reasons why opt-out works better than opt-in. First it alleviates resistance on the path of action, as the user does not have to do anything. Secondly, it’s also a form of recommendation which implies some kind of a norm - “since everyone else takes this as it is, I might also do the same”. Of course the opt-out strategy is often perceived as controversial as there are those sleazy marketers which will abuse it. One such evil is to diminish the readability of the opt-out text, while another is to use confusing text, such as double negatives. Both examples will result in users being less aware of actually signing up for something. Hence to keep the ethics in check, if you do decide to go with an opt-out approach, do make it very clear and understandable to your customers what they are being defaulted into. After all, this tactic has also been used in Europe to save lives.

> ### 26.给出默认的选项而不需要用户选择  
> 将界面做成默认用户选中想要使用你的产品，意味着如果用户真的需要使用，那么可以直接点击确定而不需要额外点选了。当然，也有另一种做法就是默认不选中服务，用户需要的话可以手动点选。前者这种设计更好的原因有两点。一是用户不需要额外点选，非常省事，因为默认设置为用户需要我们的产品或服务。二是这种做法某种程度上是在向用户推荐产品，暗示了其他人都选择了我们。当然，将界面设计成默认选择的样子多少存在点争议，有点强迫用户的感觉。如果你想道德一点，你可以要么把让用户选择的文字写得模棱两可，要么使用双重否定这样不那么直白的描述，这两种方式都可以让用户觉得没有那么强的感觉是被强迫选择使用产品的。

## 27.Try **Consistency** instead of making people relearn.
Striving for consistency in user interface design is probably one of the most well known principles since Donald Norman’s awesome books. Having a more consistent UI or interaction is simply a great way to decrease the amount of learning someone has to go through as they use an interface or product. As we press buttons and shift sliders, we learn to expect these interaction elements to look, behave and be found in the same way repeatedly. Consistency solidifies the way we learn to interact and as soon as it is taken away, we are then forced back into learning mode all over again. Consistent interfaces can be achieved through a wide possible range of things such as: colors, directions, behaviors, positioning, size, shape, labelling and language. Before we make everything consistent however, please let’s bear in mind that keeping things inconsistent still has value. Inconsistent elements or behaviors come out into attention from the depths of our habitual subconscious - which can be a good thing when you want to have things get noticed. Try it, but know when to break it.

> ### 27.保持一致性降低用户的学习成本  
> 自从Donald Norman的一系列著作面世后，界面设计中尽量保持一致性成了一个普遍遵循的准则。在设计中保持一致性可以减少用户的学习成本，用户不需要学习新的操作。当我们点击按钮，或者进行拖拽操作，我们期望这样的操作在整个程序的各个界面都是一致的，会得到相似的结果出来。反之我们需要新情境下重新学习某种操作会产生何种结果。可以在很多方面下功夫来实现一个一致的界面，包括颜色，方向，元素的表现形式，位置，大小，形状等。不过在让界面变得一致之前，记住一点，适当的打破整体的一致性也是可取的。这偶尔的不一致性的设计用在你需要强调的地方可以起到很大的作用。所以世事无绝对，我们应遵从一致的设计准则，但适当地打破这种常规。

## 28.Try **Smart Defaults** instead of asking to do extra work.
Using smart defaults or pre-filling form fields with educated guesses removes the amount of work users have to do. This is a common technique for helping users move through forms faster by being respectful of their limited time. One of the worst things from an experience and conversion stand point is to ask people for data that they have already provided in the past, repeatedly over and over again. Try to display fields that are preloaded with values to be validated as opposed to asking for values to be retyped each time. The less work, the better.

> ### 28.使用较贴切的默认值会减少操作  
> 适当的默认值和预先填充好的表单字段可以大量减少用户的工作量。在节省用户宝贵的时间上面，这是种非常常见的做法，可以帮助用户快速填完表单或者注册信息。

## 29.Try **Conventions** instead of reinventing the wheel. 
Convention is the big brother of consistency. If we keep things similar across an interface, people won’t have to obviously struggle as hard. If on the other hand, we all keep things as similar as possible across multiple interfaces, that decreases the learning curve even further. With the help of established UI conventions we learn to close screen windows in the upper right hand corner (more often than not), or expect a certain look from our settings icons. Of course there will be times when a convention no longer serves purpose and gives way to a newer pattern. When breaking away, do make sure it’s purposefully thought out and with good intention.

> ### 29.尊重用户的使用习惯而不是创造新的规则  
> 界面设计中遵从约定的准则跟之前的界面一致性准则很相似。如果我们遵从了界面设计中的一些约定，用户用起来会很方便。相反，不一致和没有遵从约定的设计则会提高学习成本。有了界面设计中这些约定，我们想都不用想就知道界面右上角（大多数情况下）的叉叉是关闭程序用的，或者点击一个按钮后我们能够预测到将会发生什么。当然，约定是会过时的，随着时间的推移，同样的操作也有可能被赋予新的含义。但要记住，当你在界面中打破这些常规时一定要目的明确，并且出发点是好的。

## 30.Try Loss Aversion instead of emphasizing gains. 
We like to win, but we hate to lose. According to the rules of persuasive psychology, we are more likely to prefer avoiding losses than to acquiring gains. This can be applied to how product offerings are framed and communicated. By underlying that a product is protective of a customer’s existing well-being, wealth or social status, such strategy might be more effective than trying to provide a customer with something additional which they don’t already have. Do insurance companies sell the payout that can be gained after the accident or the protection of the things we hold dear to us?

> ### 30.提示用户如何规避风险，而不是总想着如何获利  
> 我们喜欢成功，没有谁愿意失败。根据心理学得到的可靠结论，人们一般更顷向于避免失去拥有的东西而不是获得新的利益。这一结论也适用于产品的设计和推广中。试着说明你的产品会帮助客户维护他的利益，保持健康，社会地位等要好过告诉客户这个产品会带来一些他未曾拥有的东西。比如保险公司，它是在销售我们出事之后可以得到的大笔赔偿呢还是在强调可以帮助我们避免失去拥有的财产？
