## 11.Try **More Contrast** instead of similarity. 
Making your calls to action be a bit more prominent and distinguishable in relation to the elements surrounding them, will make your UI stronger. You can easily increase the contrast of your primary calls to action in a number of ways. Using tone, you can make certain elements appear darker vs. lighter. With depth, you can make an item appear closer while the rest of the content looks like it's further (talking drop shadows and gradients here). Finally, you can also pick complementary colors from the color wheel (ex: yellow and violet) to raise contrast even further. Taken together, a higher contrast between your call to action and the rest of the page should be considered.

> ### 11.界面要有鲜明对比让人容易区分  
> 把主要功能区从界面中突出显示出来效果会好很多。使你的主要口号醒目有很多种方法。通过明暗色调的对比来突显。通过为元素添加阴影渐变等效果让界面富有层次感来张显主题。最后，你甚至可以在色相环上专门选择互补色（比如黄色与紫色）来设计你的界面，以达到突出重心的目的。综合所有这些，最后得到的界面会使你的主要意图与界面其他元素有明显的区分，得到完美的呈现。

## 12.Try **Showing Where It's Made** instead of being generic.
Indicating where you, your product or service is from says quite a bit subliminally while at the same time moves your communication to a more personal level. Mentioning the country, state or city of origin is surely a very human like way to introduce oneself. If you can do the same virtually then you just might be perceived as a bit more friendly. Often, stating where your product is being made at also has a pretty good chance of making it feel of slightly higher quality. It's a win win.

> ### 12.直接标出产地，别总单纯的讲历史  
> 指明你的地区，所提供的服务，产品来自哪里意义重大，同时也将与客户的沟通引入了一个更具体带有地域特色的场景中。指出具体来自哪里，国家，省分及城市，也是一种在进行自我介绍或产品展示时被常常提及的。当你在界面设计中实现这点时，让人觉得非常友好。同时指明区域也会隐形提高产品的声誉，好上加好。

## 13.Try **Fewer Form Fields** instead of asking for too many.
Human beings are inherently resistant to labor intensive tasks and this same idea also applies to filling out form fields. Each field you ask for runs the risk of making your visitors turn around and give up. Not everyone types at the same speed, while typing on mobile devices is still a chore in general. Question if each field is really necessary and remove as many fields as possible. If you really have numerous optional fields, then also consider moving them after form submission on a separate page or state. It's so easy to bloat up your forms, yet fewer fields will convert better.

> ### 13.使用简洁的表单  
> 人生性就懒惰，在填写表单时也是同样的道理，没人愿意填写一大堆表单字段。表单中每个字段都会有失去用户的风险。不是每个人打字都很快速的，并且在移动设备上进行输入更是相当麻烦的事情。问下自己表单中是不是每个字段都必需，然后尽量减少表单中的字段。如果你确实需要一大堆信息让用户填写，试着将它们分散在不同页面，在表单提交后还可以继续补充。过多字段很容易让整个表单显示臃肿，当然想简洁也很容易，只放少数字段。

## 14.Try **Exposing Options** instead of hiding them.
Each pull down menu that you use, hides a set of actions within which require effort to be discovered. If those hidden options are central along the path to getting things done by your visitors, then you might wish to consider surfacing them a bit more up front. Try to reserve pull down menus for options that are predictable and don’t require new learning as in sets of date and time references (ex: calendars) or geographic sets. Occasionally pull down menu items can also work for those interfaces that are highly recurring in terms of use - actions that a person will use repeatedly over time (ex: action menus). Be careful of using drop downs for primary items that are on your path to conversion.

> ### 14.把选项列出来而不是藏起来  
> 你使用的任何一个下拉框都会对用户造成信息的隐藏而需要额外的操作才能显示。如果这些信息是贯穿整个操作所必需的，那你最好把它展示出来做得更显而易见一点。下拉框最好用在选择日期，省份等约定俗成的地方。对于程序中重要的选项最好还是不要做成下拉形式。

## 15.Try **Suggesting Continuity** instead of false bottoms.
A false bottom is a conversion killer. Yes, scrolling long pages are great, but be careful of giving your visitors a sense that the page has come to an end somewhere in between sections where it really hasn't. If your pages will scroll, try to establish a visual pattern or rhythm that the user can learn and rely on to read further down. Secondarily, be careful of big gaps in around the areas of where the fold can appear (of course I’m referring to a area range here with so many device sizes out there).

> ### 15.使用连续性的提示符，别让用户误以为页面到了终点  
> 一个平淡无奇行文无疑会让用户失去兴趣而继续阅读。是的，单列滚动的长页面是不错的，但是我们应该适当地设置一些小节，并且环环相扣，来提高用户的兴趣使其继续阅读。但需要注意的是节与节之间的留白不要太大。

## 16.Try **Keeping Focus** instead of drowning with links.
It’s easy to create a page with lots of links going left and right in the hope of meeting as many customer needs as possible. If however you’re creating a narrative page which is building on towards a specific call to action at the bottom, then think twice. Be aware that any link above the primary CTA runs the risk of taking your customers away from what you’ve been hoping them to do. Keep an eye out on the number of links on your pages and possibly balance discovery style pages (a bit heavier on the links) with tunnel style pages (with fewer links and higher conversions). Removing extraneous links can be a sure way to increase someone’s chances of reaching that important button.

> ### 16.功能专一而不是使用太多的链接  
> 为了满足各式用户的需求，在页面上放些链接链到这里链到那里是常见的做法。如果你的主要目的是想让用户点击页面最后那个下载按扭什么的话，就需要三思了。因为用户可能点击了其他链接离开页面了。所以你需要注意页面的链接数量，最好将用于导航与用于操作的链接用样式区分开。尽量移除页面不需要的链接会让用户点击到你的功能按钮。

## 17.Try **Showing State** instead of being state agnostic.
In any user interface we quite often show elements which can have different states. Emails can be read or unread, invoices can be paid or not, etc. Informing users about the particular state in which an item is in, is a good way of providing feedback. Interface states can help people understand whether or not their past actions have been successfully carried out, as well as whether an action should be taken.

> ### 17.将操作的状态或者进度呈现出来  
> 现如今大多界面当中已经呈现了各色样式的进度条或者标明状态的图标，比如邮件有已读或未读的状态，电子帐单有支付或未支付的状态。而在界面上呈现这样的状态对于用户来说是很有必要的。这样用户就可以知道某些操作是否成功，接下来准备进行怎样的操作。

## 18.Try **Benefit Buttons** instead of just task based ones.
Imagine two simple buttons displayed on a page. One button tells you that it will “Save You Money”, while the other one asks you to “Sign Up”. I’d place my bets that the first one might have a higher chance of being acted on, as a sign up on it’s own has no inherent value. Instead, a sign up process takes effort and is often associated with lengthy forms of some sort. The hypothesis set here is that buttons which reinforce a benefit might lead to higher conversions. Alternatively, the benefit can also be placed closely to where the action button is in order to remind people why they are about to take that action. Surely, there is still room for task based actions buttons, but those can be reserved for interface areas that require less convincing and are more recurring in use.

> ### 18.在动作按钮上增加些吸引人的诱惑  
> 试想界面上有这样两个按钮：一个是"获取折扣"，另一个是"立即注册"。我敢打赌大多数人会点击第一个，因为第二个按扭让人感觉不到有利可图，并且"注册"让人联想到填不完的表单。也就是说让用户感受到获利的按钮更有可能被点击。这种让用户感到好处的文字信息也可放在按钮旁边，不一定要做为按钮的标题。当然，正常的按钮还是有用处的，一般用于重复性操作频繁的地方。

## 19.Try **Direct Manipulation** instead of contextless menus.
Occasionally it makes sense to allow certain UI elements to be acted upon directly as opposed to listing unassociated generic actions. When displaying lists of data for example, we typically want to allow the user to do something with the items in the list. Clicking on, or hovering over an item in this list can be used to express that a particular item is to be manipulated (deleted, renamed, etc.). Another example of common direct manipulation would be clicking on a data item (say a text based address) which then turns into an editable field. Enabling such interactions cuts through the number of required steps, compared to if the same task was started more generally without the context of the item - since selection is already taken care of. Do keep in mind of course that for generic item-agnostic actions, there is nothing wrong with contextless menus.

> ### 19.用直接操作来代替无数个菜单  
> 不用说直接在元素身上进行操作是更直观明了的方式。比如在一个列表中，我们想让用户对每个条目进行操作那么就把按钮放到当前条目上，而不要把放到列表之外。再比如就是直接点击元素就进入编辑状态（比如页面上的地址信息点击后可以进行编辑）。这种方式比传统的选中再点击相应的按钮进行操作要简洁省事得多。当然，对于一般性的操作本身就不需要有什么上下文的，就没必要这么做了，比如页面上的前进，后退按扭。

## 20.Try **Exposing Fields** instead of creating extra pages.
When creating landing pages that convey value, it can be beneficial to show the actual form fields on the conversion page itself. Merging the sign up form with the landing page comes with a number of benefits in comparison to creating separate multi-page sign ups. First, we are cutting out extra steps from the flow in general and the task at hand takes less time. Secondly, by showing the number of form fields right there, we are also providing the customer with a sense of how long the sign up actually is. This of course is a little easier when our forms are shorter in the first place (which of course they should be if possible).

> ### 20.尽量显示全部内容而不要额外页面  
> 在一个足够大的宽屏界面上最好还是直接给出表单，这比点击按钮再弹出表单要好很多。首先减少了点击操作，流程变得简洁也节省了时间。其次，直接呈现出表单可以让用户知道表单有多长，其实也是在告诉用户注册花不了多少时间。当然，这条规则适合注册表单非常简单的情况。
