## 61.Try **Providing Feedback** instead of silence.   
When we perform an action or task, we want to know that it has been successfully completed. Feedback provides this closure to any action. It can be as subtle as the drying of ink on a piece of paper, or as blunt as a dialogue message confirming that one of your emails has been delivered. Silence on the other hand breeds uncertainty. Did it really work? Did I hear a click? Was the button really pressed? Should I try again? Feedback answers all these questions. It is a very valuable and essential element for any successful interaction.

## 62.Try **Anticipating Intent** instead of shortsightedness. 
Feelings of “yes this is exactly what I was looking for” may be brought on by some form of intent anticipation by the user interace. Having a UI which correctly guesses what the user is after, should in turn bring in more smiles and dollars (or at least less frowns). As one example, Amazon.com has achieved this at the micro interaction level with their mega drop down menu. The menu essentially detects intent of the correct sub-menu to display using some interesting geometry and front-end engineering. It saves the user the pain of moving the cursor across a diagonal line towards a desired sub-menu, only to discover that the sub-menu changed to something else or disappeared altogether. Detecting the user’s intent however is a balancing act that may be easier with simpler and scripted interactions. The playing field is still wide open for more advanced intent detection which might require stronger artificial intelligence.

## 63.Try **Extra Padding** instead of overcrowding elements. 
White space can definitely make content and/or data more readable. When elements are slightly separated away from each, they begin to be allowed to be perceived individually. This can be good for lists, tables, paragraphs or any sets of elements on a screen. One common way of applying white space is with extra padding all around an item. Without adequate padding on the other hand, elements begin to blur together into indistinguishable wholes. So when readability is concerned, padding may help.

## 64.Try **Storytelling** instead of listing just the facts. 
Storytelling is the oldest form of communication which could be used on landing pages, applications and various UI interactions. Instead of listing out the information in bullet point form, why not give narrative a try? A basic story will have a few simple elements such as a setting, a character with intentions, and some problematic situation just around the corner. Stories elicit a more emotional response by making it feel as if the written experience was actually encountered. As a result of this, stories may also become more memorable. Long form sales letters have directly applied storytelling, which could be the reason why they are still effective to this day.

## 65.Try **Authenticity** instead of faking it. 
Most people can sniff out a liar a mile away. Aiming to be authentic may be just the cure in helping your product or screen in becoming more trustworthy. Stock images including happy people smiling just about no good reasons, may be suspect number one in undermining trust. There are a few tests out there which have hinted at this here and there. Another area which may often be a source of skepticism are product reviews. Having a mix of good and bad reviews as opposed to just the shiny ones, may also help. Finally, having precise non-rounded numbers may also be perceived as more believable as well.

## 66.Try **Progressive Reduction** instead of being static. 
Progressive Reduction has been discussed by LayerVault. It's a rather simple idea that as users learn to use your interface or application, the functions which where more important in the beginning, become easier or less important over time. For example, certain onboarding related calls to actions may be moved further away as room is made for other content. Or, icon labels may become hidden as the meaning of icons becomes understood. People learn to use an interface and the progressive reduction pattern respects that.

## 67.Try **Putting Others First** instead of self-centeredness. 
Putting others’ interests ahead of yours, while building social influence as a result, isn’t a new idea at all. Reframing conversations from “I” to “You”, listening well, and being genuinely interested in others, have all been central in Dale Carnegie’s How to Win Friends and Influence People, almost a century ago. Our level of being audience, customer or user centric expresses itself in the language and interactions we (or our products) make use of or enable. More so, apparently arguing against one’s own self-interest may be a strong source of additional credibility, as has been observed in a social experiment. Sometimes, seeing and telling things from other people's perspective (even if it does not immediately benefit) may in fact result in a constructive action that ends benefiting everyone.

## 68.Try **Explaining** instead of assuming the obvious. 
Some things which may seem obvious to us, might be less so to others. Form fields are probably the classic example of this with their open ended nature. That’s where explanations, descriptions, and hints come in. Using contextual explanations uncertainties may be removed in numerous ways by communicating: the reason for asking for information, an example of acceptable input, a requirement, or where to find the information being asked for. One thing to keep in mind when using such contextual descriptions however, is not to use them as placeholder text within the form field itself - as Jakob Nielson has warned.

## 69.Try **Concise Copy** instead of using unnecessary words.
Get to the point by writing shorter sentences, using simpler and fewer words. After writing the first draft, see if you can condense it. Showing the core message will convey what you intended without losing someone’s attention. Here are 5 simple tips on tighter writing while avoiding the passive voice and meaningless words.

## 70.Try **Responsive Layouts** instead of static ones. 
There is nothing worse in the world than double scroll-bars. Seriously, it’s as cognitively taxing as looking at a map through a keyhole. Some of these weird situations might be caused unintentionally due to static layouts when looking at UIs on smaller devices. One way around this problem, of course, is with responsive layouts that adjust automatically for various screen shapes and sizes.
