## 51.Try **Price Illusions** instead of just plain prices.
You can let people judge the value of your product completely on their own, or you can help to do it for them. If you decide to make use of human irrationality, you can show the price in a way so that your offering becomes perceived as more valuable. In the simplest way you can start off with framing words such as "only", "affordable", or "small fee of" alongside of the price. The price then can also be broken down into a per unit price (ex: 30¢ per page rather than $30 for a book, or $1 per day instead of $30 per month for a membership). Further, the infamous prices ending in a "9" instead of having a round number can also be used. Finally, prices can be shown with fewer digits ($30, instead of $30.00) for an additional effect of illusion.

## 52.Try Thanking instead of simply confirming completion.
Thanking people can make you, your business, product or UI feel more human as it shows you're appreciative and you care. Thanking of course happens during some sort of task completion and is bigger than just plain feedback. More so, making your UI thankful can be used as a way to induce further dialogue or action. So naturally, thank you screens are a perfect spot to suggest the next optional action for the customer or user to take. Thanks for reading this paragraph. :)

## 53.Try Useful Calculations instead of asking to do math.
A user interface can do mathematical calculations, large or small, for users and thus remove unnecessary friction. As one example, let's say that some application shows used up credits out of an available pool. It might be more meaningful to calculate for users how many remaining days that actually is before their application stops functioning. Or yet an even simpler and more popular example when we try to understand how recent or old multiple rows of data really are. In this case a relative time stamp of "3 min ago" has more meaning and requires less effort to comprehend than say an absolute one of "4:37pm, Sept 2". Take out the pain of having to do the math.

## 54.Try Reaffirming Freedom instead of implying it.
People may be persuaded to act more often when their choice or free will is explicitly reaffirmed. There have been some studies done on the "But You Are Free" technique with cases where the effect to act sometimes even doubled. The idea is to call out an action or decision, followed by a simple statement suggesting that "it's your choice", or "you are free to refuse", etc. The persuasive power of this technique seemed the strongest when the request was made face-to-face and/or the request to act and reaffirmation were closer together.

## 55.Try Variable Rewards instead of predictability.
Variable rewards are great way to get users hooked. When we (or mice at least) press levers that spit out pellets unpredictably (as in sometimes not spitting out anything), then such a schedule of reinforcement has the highest rate of response in the shortest amount of time. If eating pellets isn't your thing however, then please consider how addictive email checking can be as we never really know when those "rewarding ones" really do appear (assuming you receive more than just the same old email from Joe everyday).

## 56.Try Attention Grabs instead of neglect.
It's worth channelling additional attention towards the most important actions. This can be achieved in numerous ways starting with the more obvious size increase or higher contrast of an element. Other ways for directing attention also include: using irregular shapes, field auto focusing, section highlights, sticky element interactions (floating), as well as directional arrows. Surely you cannot have everything scream on a page, but emphasizing the primary calls to action is worth the effort.

## 57.Try Friendly Comparisons instead of confusion.
User interface sometimes rely on comparison between changed content (as in diff tools) or product characteristic (as in product comparison charts). There are a couple ways in which such comparisons can be made more understandable and drive ease of use. First of all, limiting the number of things to compare at one given time to two is one simple way of alleviating such confusion. This could be further strengthened by aligning and placing in proximity the two compared items together. This way there is no doubt as to what is being compared to what. Secondly, having a clear indication of the "better" or "most recent" version might remove some of the guess work. Thirdly, show clearly which attributes changed and which didn’t. In other words, show what was added (or is better), what was removed (or is worse), and finally what stayed the same.

## 58.Try Set Collections instead of independent items.
People are motivated to collect things. Whether physical or virtual, seeing a closed set of things to collect from establishes a goal to strive for. Often obtaining the complete set can motivate even further by carrying added benefits of synergistic qualities (a cake is bigger and better than its individual ingredients). Perhaps, showing items which have been already collected, also reinforces behavior by showing past actions as achievement. Finally, the motivation to collect a complete set might be stronger if the number of items is known to be finite (overlaying scarcity).

## 59.Try Expectation Setting instead of being ignorant.
It's nice when people set expectations for each other. It doesn't take much effort for a person or interface to inform someone when the next task will be completed. You are on step 1 of X. Your choice will result in Y. You will receive something before Z. All those little promises not only inform but also build trust. Unhelpful interfaces on the other hand can come off a little cold as the user is kept in the dark.

## 60.Try Humor instead of being so serious.
Why should everything always have to be so serious all the time? It doesn't. You can always lighten up by throwing in a joke or something playful here and there. Adding humor to your UI might or might not work. When it does work however, humor can build up a stronger human relationship between you and your users/customers. Having an amount of such chuckles and smiles built up and stored away for the future is probably a nice to have. When the times get tough, people who have a stronger and more personal relationship with you may be more prone to forgiveness during erroneous situations.
