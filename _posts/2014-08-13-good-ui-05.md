## 41.Try **Anchoring** instead of starting with the price. 
Humans come loaded with cognitive biases, and as Kahneman observed, anchoring is one such bias that is hard to resist. It suggests that our decision making is affected by the first quantities which come to our attention. When we start with a larger number and roll down towards a smaller price, all of a sudden that price doesn't feel as large any longer. If I understand correctly, what many people miss however, is that the anchored number also doesn't have to be a price. It can be a number which doesn't need a dollar value. A common example of marketers exploiting the anchoring effect is showing the Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price followed by a lower price.

> ### 41.使用一些对比  
> 人类的认知多少都会有一些偏差，根据Kahneman的观察，锚定这种偏差是很难抗拒的。它表明，我们的决策是由我们第一印象所影响。如果我么使用价格进行对比，就会觉得这个价格还是可以接受的。如果我的理解是正确的，很多人没有注意到这一点，锚定的数量也不一定是价格。它可以是一个数字不需要金钱附带的价值。常见的例子是营销人员利用锚定效应，开始显示制造商建议的零售价格随后由一个较低的价格。

## 42.Try **Upfront Progress** instead of starting with a blank. 
There is more motivation for getting things done the closer we are to completion. For this reason, some companies give away pre stamped coffee cards. Or in the virtual world, others reward the signup process as a completed item on the list of things to do. Stephen Anderson labeled this similar pattern as [Set Completion](http://getmentalnotes.com/cards/set_completion) in his Mental Notes, while more formally, it can be also referred to as the [Goal Gradient Effect](http://coglode.com/gems/goal-gradient-effect). Either way, do make people progress or feel like they are progressing sooner rather than later.

> ### 42.初始化的时候给用户一些激励而不是从零开始  
> 事情越是接近完成越有动力。因此，有些公司赠送一些预印咖啡卡。在虚拟世界中，注册会作为一个已完成的项目作为奖励。Stephen Anderson把这种类似的模式作为他的心理笔记，更确切地讲，它也可以被称为目标梯度效应。无论哪种方式，都让人感觉任务宜早不宜迟。

## 43.Try **Progressive Disclosure** instead of overwhelming.  
Progressive Disclosure protects the user from too much irrelevant information. It's a pattern which only shows information gradually if it makes sense to do so - often in the context of forms. Typically, progressive disclosure's gradual unveiling is also accompanied by some form of inline expansion or slide out animation. If too many fields increase effort and scare people away, then this is another tactic of avoiding having to enter unnecessary fields. Only show/ask for what is relevant to the situation at hand.

> ### 43.循序渐进地引导用户，不要简单粗暴地直接呈现给用户  
> 渐进的显示，让用户免受过多的不相关的信息。这是一种方式，如果这样做是有意义的，逐步显示信息。通常情况下，渐进的显示也伴随着某种形式的扩展或滑出的动画。如果显示太多，访问者会望而却步。

## 44.Try **Smaller Commitments** instead of one big one.  
Ask people to start off with a smaller upfront commitment followed by some larger ones down the road. Big commitments can scare people off. Borrowing from Robert Cialdini's work, using commitment is a powerful persuasion strategy which taps into people's desire to be seen as having a consistent self image. That quest for consistency suggests that generally people can climb a series of smaller and connected actions more easily than one larger one. An application stemming from this is known as the foot in the door technique which works by “getting a small 'yes' and then getting an even bigger 'yes.'”. One example of this would be a dating site that is asking people to just look around, followed by an introduction task, followed by a couple ideas for a date, etc. This is opposite of course to asking the same users to lock into a marriage right away (nothing wrong with getting married). :) In the context of pricing, another example can be seen when we ask customers to pay a series of monthly fees instead of an annual one. A related tactic of lowering upfront commitment might also show a “no contract” messaging in order to make customers feel that they can leave anytime which further decreases the barrier to entry.

> ### 44.试着给一个小的承诺  
> 先给用户一个较小的承诺随后再给一个较大的。大的承诺可能会吓跑用户。借用Robert Cialdini的研究成果，使用承诺是一个强大的说服策略，利用人的欲望被认为是具有一致性自我形象。这个任务一致的表明，一般人能胜任一系列较小的连接比一个大的行动更容易。应用程序从这个被为寸进尺法（是一种通过先提出一个简单的小请求来说服被劝说者同意一个较大请求的劝说方法）,举一个这方面的例子，有一个交友网站，要求人们只是四处看看，接着介绍了任务，随后由一对夫妇约会……相反的就是要求相同的用户马上结婚（结婚没有错）。在定价方面，另一个例子可以看出，当我们让客户支付每月的费用而不是一年的费用。降低前期承诺的相关策略也可能为了让客户觉得他们可以随时进一步降低了进入的门槛，显示“无合同”的消息。

## 45.Try **Softer Prompts** instead of modal windows. 
The modal window or dialog box is an attention hog, like it or not. Grabbing someone's attention can be a good thing, but modal windows often come with some nasty problems. First of all, modal windows can block users from performing other functions or referencing information from behind the modal. They can also be difficult to get out of for some users. Dialog boxes are also at fault for often halting the computer from completing given work which can be irritating if the user is away. Finally, modals may frustrate with interruption if someone is deep in their task and not ready to take other actions. Why not consider more subtle inline or slide out methods which might be less obtrusive and can equally capture people's attention?

> ### 45.试着柔和的提示而不是弹框。  
> 弹框或对话框是一个独占的关注，喜欢或不喜欢。抓住用户的注意力是一件好事，但弹框通常有一些讨厌的问题。首先，弹框可以阻止用户执行其他功能或参考弹框后面的的信息。某些用户难以摆脱。如果用户离开计算机，对话框也经常阻止出故障的计算机而不能完成给定的工作。最后，当一个人正专心于自己的工作的时候，一个弹框会打乱他的工作。为什么不考虑更微妙的内嵌或滑出，可能不太突出的方法同样能抓住人们的注意力？

## 46.Try **Multifunctional Controls** instead of more parts. 
Simplicity is often valued in design as it somewhat correlates with ease of use. Too much clutter may burn through our limited attention pools and the more parts there are, the more room for usability issues to creep up. One way for the user interface to achieve the same with less is to make UI controls more multifunctional. That is, you take one control and you squeeze two or more functions into it. As one example, we can combine a search input field with a filtering mechanism that affects a list below right as you type. This removes the need for additional filters. We can also combine a ranking display with a rating onhover function to further avoid additional parts. Multifunctionalism isn't all that golden though. Although it simplifies, it does so at the cost of discoverability. Functions which are less visible up front run the risk of not being found. It's therefore probably better to reserve the multifunctional approach for repeat visitors which can deal with a slightly higher learning curve. Also, use it wisely and don't over do it.

## 47.Try **Icon Labels** instead of opening for interpretation.  
Icons can be wide open to interpretation and combining them with words can remove some of the ambiguity. Take a down arrow icon for example. Does it mean to move something down, lower its priority, or download? Or does an “x” icon mean to delete, disable, or close? The problem becomes larger for light use interfaces where there isn't much time for the person to learn the meaning of the icons. To make the icons more understandable, they can be augmented with textual labels. If space is truly an issue, some user interfaces compromise by showing all of their icon labels on a single hover (less painful than having to hover on each individual icon).

## 48.Try **Natural Language** instead of dry text.  
Natural language is a more informal and conversational interaction style than just short, strict and formal words. This style is often associated with computers being able to understand (or seem like they understand) humans better, forgive where necessary, and vice versa. The expectation is two fold. First, a person types in a phrase which the computer would ideally comprehend the full meaning of. Second, the responses by the computer are also more conversational and friendly in return. Although we might not be fully there yet with the first part, there are some basic and promising examples such as: searching for “toronto weather” in Google, Ubiquity for Firefox and Siri commands. As for interfaces which display their messages as conversations there are some hints that they might convert just a bit better (some more testing required).

## 49.Try **Curiosity** instead of being reserved.  
Stirring curiosity is a conversion tactic which tries to drive up desire for something by providing a bit of teasing information. It could be a sample chapter, a demo, a trial, or some free genuine content which leads up to a call to action sounding like “in order to see the rest, do XYZ”. Teasing your users, customers and/or leads with samples and hooks is a good way for people to want to continue on the path of action. As obvious as it sounds, another sure shot way to fail at stirring curiosity (aside of not having it at all in the first place) is of course by providing the complete range of information or offering upfront. Perhaps giving people a full trial, or all of X out of Y before they are customers, isn't the best way to motivate them. Keep them hungry for more - at least for a bit. :)

## 50.Try **Reassurances** instead of assuming all is fine.
When you're closing a sale, drop some reassurances. Throw in a guarantee, tell your customers that they will be satisfied, tell them that the payment is secure, that yes shipping is free, and yes that they can pull out at anytime without any risk. All is good and all will be fine. Don't worry, be happy. Putting a positive spin on a close is definitely worth a try as a conversion tactic. 

> ### 50.尽量的保证而不是假设一切都很好    
> 当你完成了一次销售，减少一些的保证。再加上担保，告诉你的客户，他们就很满足了，告诉他们支付是安全的，这次运输是免费的，是的，他们可以随时拉出来，没有任何风险。一切都很好，一切都会好起来的。不要担心，要快乐。把一个正面的一个密切的，绝对是值得一试的转换策略。
